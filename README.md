# AES_and_RSA_Encryption_and_Decryption

This project aims to implement two of the most widely used encryption algorithms - AES and RSA. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric-key encryption algorithm, which is widely used for securing data in transit and at rest. RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a public-key encryption algorithm that is used for secure data transmission, digital signatures, and key exchange.
The project will involve the implementation of both AES and RSA algorithms in Python programming language. The implementation will involve the following steps:
1.	Implementation of the AES algorithm using Python's cryptography library for encryption and decryption of data.
2.	Implementation of the RSA algorithm using Python's cryptography library for generating public and private keys, encryption and decryption of data.
3.	Comparison of the performance of both AES and RSA algorithms in terms of encryption and decryption time, and security.
4.	Implementation of a user-friendly interface for inputting data, selecting the encryption algorithm (AES or RSA), and displaying the encrypted/decrypted data.
